## Customization

### System Prompt

The default system prompt gives the chatbot a hacker-themed personality. You can modify this by clicking the "Edit System Prompt" button. The prompt uses {Z} as a placeholder for the user's message.

### Color Scheme

The application uses a dark, hacker-inspired theme with customizable ASCII art colors. Modify the color constants at the beginning of the script to change the overall appearance:

```python
# Color palette
BG_BLACK = "#000000"        # Main background
DARK_GRAY = "#111111"       # Secondary background
LIGHT_GRAY = "#CCCCCC"      # Text color
BLUE_PRIMARY = "#3B82F6"    # Default ASCII art color
BLUE_SECONDARY = "#1E40AF"  # Default shadow color
BLUE_HIGHLIGHT = "#60A5FA"  # Highlight blue
```

## Development

This project uses:
- Tkinter for the GUI
- Pyfiglet for ASCII art generation
- Pillow for image manipulation
- Requests for API communication with Ollama
